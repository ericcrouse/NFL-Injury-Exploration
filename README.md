# NFL-Injury-Exploration
Exploratory analysis on effects of injuries in the NFL, including team performance, team valuation, and an injury prediction model.

Data was sourced from Kaggle and scraped from various online databases such as Pro-Football_Reference.com. This data was preprocessed and merged to create master.xlsx, and several original datasets were transformed to contain uniform team names, player names, season and date format, etc. From these original datasets, the 3 files in /data/raw were created and subsequently used in this project.

Not all code from every team member is available on this repository. Details concerning how data was gathered and processed are available in the final report under /results.
